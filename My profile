Interest in IT

It could give me a feeling that I'm acturally creating something. I start learning Java was in high school. For now, I can still remember the excited I got when I finish my first Program. It was a simple calculator application. 
The reason why I came to Rmit. Because RMIT is located in city and I'd like to spend a lot of time in city. It also doesn't have the pressure like Monash or University of Melbourne. 
I'm trying to gain more skills during my study suck as learning c language and IT design.

Personal Profile


Result of Myers-Briggs test.

If anyone can make friends with their colleagues and keep tension at bay within their team, it’s Entertainers. A fun atmosphere is important, and people with the Entertainer personality type use their strong observational and social skills to bring everyone together, shifting a souring mood if need be. Entertainers rarely want for ideas on how to make this happen, happily organizing events and activities inside and outside the workplace. Entertainers’ spontaneity, wit, and enthusiasm have no equal. 

Entertainers genuinely enjoy spending time with others and getting to know them, and have a knack for making people happy, even in the most frustrating situations. A good challenge is always appreciated by Entertainer personalities, and they make wonderful and inspiring counselors, social workers, personal coaches, and consultants who improve employee or customer satisfaction.\
