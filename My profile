Interest in IT

It could give me a feeling that I'm acturally creating something. I start learning Java was in high school. For now, I can still remember the excited I got when I finish my first Program. It was a simple calculator application. 
The reason why I came to Rmit. Because RMIT is located in city and I'd like to spend a lot of time in city. It also doesn't have the pressure like Monash or University of Melbourne. 
I'm trying to gain more skills during my study suck as learning c language and IT design.
